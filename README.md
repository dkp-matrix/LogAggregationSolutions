# Log Aggregation Solutions

A comprehensive suite of tools and libraries for modern log aggregation, analysis, and management in .NET applications.

## Overview

LogAggregationSolutions is a collection of projects designed to demonstrate, test, and implement efficient log management strategies for .NET applications. The solution focuses on centralized logging, performance benchmarking, and integration with popular log aggregation systems.

## Projects

### LokiLogger

A testing and benchmarking tool for Grafana Loki integration with .NET applications using Serilog. This project evaluates Loki's capabilities for log ingestion, querying, and visualization via Grafana.

[View LokiLogger Documentation](./LokiLogger/README.md)

#### Key Features:

- Performance benchmarking for log ingestion
- Serilog integration with Grafana Loki
- Comprehensive test suite for log filtering and querying
- Date-based log organization and retrieval

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- .NET 6.0 or later
- Grafana (for visualization)
- Grafana Loki (for log storage and querying)

### Building the Solution

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/LogAggregationSolutions.git

# Navigate to the solution directory
cd LogAggregationSolutions

# Build the solution
dotnet build
```

### Running Projects

```bash
# Run LokiLogger
cd LokiLogger
dotnet run
```

## Architecture

The solution follows a modular architecture where each project addresses specific aspects of log aggregation:

- **LokiLogger**: Focuses on Grafana Loki integration and performance benchmarking

Future planned components:

- **Log enrichment libraries**: For adding contextual information to logs
- **Log visualization tools**: For custom log analysis dashboards
- **Additional backend integrations**: For other popular log aggregation systems

## Common Use Cases

- Performance testing logging backends
- Evaluating log query efficiency
- Implementing structured logging
- Setting up centralized logging for distributed applications

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please feel free to submit a Pull Request.

## Roadmap

- Add support for additional log aggregation systems
- Create a unified dashboard for comparing performance metrics
- Develop libraries for automatic log enrichment
- Implement machine learning components for log analysis and anomaly detection
